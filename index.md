# Smoking Cigarettes... Again

Yesterday [I wrote about smoking cigarettes and going out](https://jnapolitano.com/en/posts/cigarettes/). I had told myself I was oer it.. but the momentum is difficult to overcome.  

## A Date Before I Leave Town

I had coffee with someone that I am interested before taking off on a road trip to Colorado.  At the root of it I think I am attracted to her. I can come up with a number of reasons why.. but I do not really know.  

## Coffee

I had a few cups of coffee during the date... actually as I write this I am drinking another espress...  I like stimulants. I have never tried anything illegal or strong. I am addicted already to caffeine. Anything stronger I feel will ruin me

## What Do I Want

You know... I do not know.  I think about what I want to do and only regurgitate what I think I should do. I want to act more authentically but I do not know if there really is an authentic self to satisfy. I might.. just might have the agency to create myself so to speak through my actions.. but really I am subject to my biology and my social setting. I am a product of factors beyond my control. I do not know if it is possible to really satisfy myself.. my self may not really exist. 

## Cigarettes... again

So here I am.... listening to the man in black sing about the down and out.. .the poor without anything to eat... the usual. Is it a worthy pursuit. I like the idea of justice. I hate the fact that people take advantage of others.. but to satisfy the self maybe this is the way.. To satisfy the soul of the christian might be equivalent to the satisfaction of the capitalist. Different conditions lead to different strategies.. but the goal is social acceptance and personal satisfaction that is the result.  

A cigarette down. The cigarettes I left on the parking barrier last night... hoping a wanderer (idk the correct terminology now) would pick them up. They did not. I found them. I smoked a cig... I felt like a goofball... I considered the executives in Winston Salem smirking because I bought the propaganda they put out to help me justify smoking this brand... Regardless I hit it again and again... I took it to the filter... I put those cigarettes down where I left them yesterday hoping for the same outcome.
