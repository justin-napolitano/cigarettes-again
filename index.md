# Smoking Cigarettes... Again

Yesterday [I wrote about smoking cigarettes and going out](https://jnapolitano.com/en/posts/cigarettes/). I had told myself I was over it....  

## A Date Before I Leave Town

I had coffee with someone that I am interested before taking off on a road trip to Colorado.  At the root of it I think I am attracted to her. I can come up with a number of reasons why.. but I do not really know.  

## Coffee

I had a few cups of coffee during the date... actually as I write this I am drinking another espresso...  I like stimulants.  I am addicted already to caffeine. Anything stronger I feel will ruin me.

## What Do I Want

You know... I do not know.  I think about what I want to do and only regurgitate what I think I should do. I want to act more authentically but I do not know if there really is an authentic self to satisfy. I might.. just might have the agency to create myself through my actions.. but really I am subject to my biology and my social setting. I am a product of factors beyond my control. I do not know if it is possible to really satisfy  myself.. my self may not really exist.

## Cigarettes... again

So here I am.... listening to the man in black sing about the down and out... the poor without anything to eat... the usual. Is it a worthy pursuit to represent those that cannot represent themselves? I like the idea of justice. I hate the fact that people take advantage of others.. 

A cigarette down. The cigarettes I left on the parking barrier last night... hoping a vagabond (idk the correct terminology now) would pick them up. They did not. I found them. I smoked a cig... I feel like a clown... I considered the executives in Winston Salem smirking because I bought the propaganda they put out to help me justify smoking this brand... Regardless I hit it again and again... I took it to the filter...
