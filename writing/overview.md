I created the "cigarettes-again" GitHub repo as a space to explore my reflections on smoking, anxiety, and lifestyle. It’s a unique blend of personal journaling and emotional processing — something I think many can relate to, even if the specifics differ.

## What It Is and Why It Exists

This repository is essentially a straightforward digital journal. The driving force behind it was more than just a document of experiences; it’s about grappling with the complexities of smoking and the lifestyle choices that come with it. Anxiety is a common theme in this journey. I felt the need to chronicle these thoughts in a simple, no-frills format, allowing me to revisit them whenever necessary.

The goal? To create an open platform to engage with my feelings and thoughts related to a habit that many find difficult to break — smoking. It's raw, it's personal, and quite frankly, it's therapeutic. 

## Key Design Decisions

When I designed "cigarettes-again," I wanted to keep things minimal. Here's what influenced my choices:

- **Markdown Format**: I opted for markdown because it’s lightweight and straightforward. Anyone can read or edit it without complex tools.
- **Personal Journal Style**: The content focuses on capturing personal experiences and musings, making it less of a structured blog and more of a reflective journal.
- **Simplicity**: I avoided any overly-complex setup. The minimal structure ensures that readers can easily navigate the content without distractions.

This wasn’t about crafting a full-blown application; rather, it’s about writing and sharing feelings.

## Technology Stack

The tech stack is intentionally simple:

- **Markdown**: For content formatting. It's flexible and easy to work with.
- **Static Site Generator**: I envision it would work well with one, although it’s currently not included in the repo. This would be an upgrade for future iterations.

## Project Structure

The repository structure is just as minimal as the content itself:

```
index.md     # This is where all the main journaling starts
images/      # A placeholder for any images I might want to include later
```

It’s clear, easy to understand, and moves away from the clutter that can make personal reflections feel overwhelming.

## Tradeoffs

Every design decision has its tradeoffs. With "cigarettes-again," there are a few worth mentioning:

- **Flexibility vs. Structure**: By keeping it simple, I prioritize flexibility but compromise on customization. For instance, if I wanted advanced features like tagging or categorization, I would need to find ways to integrate them without complicating the layout.
- **No Backend**: There isn’t a backend to store or manage data. This makes everything faster and easier to use, but I lose out on features like search or filtering previous entries.

## What I’d Like to Improve or Add Next

Looking ahead, I’ve got some ideas to enhance "cigarettes-again":

- **More Journal Entries**: I want to continue this exploration and document more reflections. The more I write, the more I understand.
- **Static Site Integration**: Bringing in a static site generator would really take this project to the next level. It’d allow for a cleaner presentation and better personal blog deployment.
- **Tagging and Categorization**: I can see the value in organizing entries. This would help in revisiting themes or feelings over time.
- **Multimedia Content**: Beyond markdown, I’d love to incorporate images or even audio reflections. It’d make the whole experience richer.

## Follow Along

I share updates about this project and other personal insights on social media platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter/X. It’s a great way to stay connected, so feel free to follow along.

In the end, "cigarettes-again" is more than just a GitHub repository. It’s a personal journey through reflection, anxiety, and lifestyle choices. I hope it resonates with others who dive into their struggles and emerge with insights worth sharing.
